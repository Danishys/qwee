<h1>Why Do I Like Winter?</h1>
<h2>I like winter because I thinks its a nice feeling to wear the clothes in winter. I am a fan of wearing jackets and I can't really do that in summer. 
The holidays are also very fun with Christmas and International Childrens Day. I just get to have a lot of time off and spend quality time with my family.
Also food tastes a lot better during winter. The feeling of eating warm and hot food on a cold day can not be beaten. Once again benefits from Christmas 
being able to get lots of presents with plenty of time to use them. Also the last month of the year so waiting for new years is also a fun event with the 
family.</h2>
